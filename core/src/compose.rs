//! This module provides utilities for composing multipart mails.
//!
//! While the `Mail` type on itself can represent any multipart
//! mail most mails have a certain pattern to their structure,
//! consisting mainly of `multipart/mixed` for attachments,
//! `multipart/alternative` for alternative bodies and
//! `multipart/related` for including embedded resources which
//! can be used in the mail bodies  like e.g. a logo.
//!
//! This module provides the needed utilities to more simply
//! create a `Mail` instance which represents this kind of
//! mails.

//-------------------------------------------------------------\\
// NOTE: Implementations for creating (composing) mails are    ||
// split from the type dev, and normal impl blocks and placed  ||
// in the later part of the file for better readability.       ||
